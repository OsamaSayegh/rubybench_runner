# RubybenchRunner

This gem serves as a CLI tool to run the benchmarks at rubybench.org locally. Right now it's limited to the Rails benchmark. More details and installation/usage instructions are available [here](https://rubybench.org/run-locally).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

You can also use the `exe/rubybench_runner` executable to test and preview your changes.
